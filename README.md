The **notebook presented** can be found [here](https://github.com/alonsosilvaallende/2024-PyData-Global/blob/main/PyData-Global.ipynb).

To run the notebook, install the `requirements.txt`:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need to install `llama-cpp-python` and the installation will depend if you're using GPUs or not. In the simplest case (without GPUs):
```
pip install llama-cpp-python
```
Otherwise, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

This presentation took place on December 5, 2024.

The **abstract** of this presentation is:

> Knowledge graphs are excellent at representing and storing heterogeneous and interconnected information in a structured manner, effectively capturing complex relationships and attributes across different data types. Structured text generation allows for building knowledge graphs by providing neatly structured outputs, making it an ideal method for extracting structured information. Similarly, structured text generation enables the creation of agents by defining which tools are allowed and what action inputs are permitted. In this talk, we first build a graph database from unstructured data and then we create an agent to query the graph database. We will show these capabilities with a demo.
